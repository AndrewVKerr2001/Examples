## Projects (PrinciplesOfDatabaseDesign)

### Project1-1
This was my first attempt at the first project in this class, which was to design a file based database system. This attempt involved using a block based approach, where the file would be split into various blocks with 128 bytes in each block. These blocks would then store the relevant data and/or the relational links between them. The project specification was to have the database setup to store a made up college's data for students, courses, grade-letters, and transcript grades. The specification also stated that both file and command line input had to be supported. This iteration was not used in the final submission as it had been too ambitious of a setup to work.

### Project1-2
This was my second attempt at the first project in this class, the details of which are described in [Project1-1](#project1-1). This attempt went much better and I was able to submit this code without any issues.
