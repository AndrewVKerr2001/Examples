# Examples
A repository with a collection of C/C++ projects that I made during my college courses. Imported from my laptop much later down the line. This repository does __not__ represent all of the projects that I have done in my college courses, some projects may have been lost during computer transfers or left & lost on the college campus computer network after my graduation. Some projects may be recreated as I get time to work on them so that this can become a more complete repository and reflection of my programming capabilities and style.

## CompSci1
### Name: Computer Science 1

This course taught the basics of programming languages using the JAVA programming language to build off of. Lessons included syntax of programming languages, I/O statements, functions and array processing. This course focused primarily on teaching: the principles of program development; how to take a problem statement and create a program solution; and, how to implement simple algorithms to solve simple problems.

This courses projects were, unfortunately, lost to time as they used to exist on my older desktop computer. If I find time I will try to recreate them.

## CompSci2
### Name: Computer Science 2
A continuation of [Computer Science 1](#compsci1) using the C++ programming language. This course included basic C++ syntax for I/O, assignment statements, conditional statements & iterative statements, along with functions and operator overloading. It consists of multidimensional array processing, character manipulation, elementary searching and sorting techniques, along with structures & classes declarations and pointer manipulation.

## DS&Algorithms
### Name: Data Structures and Algorithms
A continuation of [Computer Science 2](#compsci2) using the C++ programming language. This course builds off of the data structures and algorithms that CompSci2 had first introduced. Additional topics included: stacks, queues, linked lists, and trees. Ideas that were introduced in this course are: recursion, graphs, and hashing techniques. Various different data structures were reviewed, if not implemented.

## PrinciplesOfDatabaseDesign
### Name: Principles of Database Design
This course was designed to introduce the idea of database theory, design and manipulation. Some of the concepts that were introduced are structuring data on secondary storage devices, file processing, and database organization. Additionally, network heirarchical models were discuess, but not in detail as focus was on application of database systems, conceptual modeling, the relational data model, and relational algebra.
