## Projects (DS&Algorithms)

### AVLTree
This project was used to learn about how a Binary Search Tree (BST) can become unbalanced and thus cause the data structure to become quite taxing to utilize. However, the AVL Tree fixes the BST structure by utilizing an insertion/removal algorithm that auto balances the BST such that all leaf nodes should _aproximately_ be equal distant from the root node. Thus the AVL Tree will reach big O(log n) in both the average and worst-case situations, while BST is stuck with big O(n) in the worst-case and big O(log n) in the average case.

### ExamProject1
This exam project was utilized to show the professor that we understand, and can implement, various sorting algorithms. Taking this project one step further the professor asked us to generate a bunch of Big O graphs that were then submitted to show the professor at a glance that the algorithms were implemented correctly, and to teach students the differences between each algorithm.

### ExamProject2
This exam project was utilized to show the students the basics of how a computer will process a program from a low-level hardware perspective. The project had us extending code given to us from the professor and implementing the execution of various different instructions. The majority of this code comes from the professor of this class, and as such I make no claim over the code that wasn't implemented by myself. Only some of the code in the Statement.cpp, and Stack.cpp files are my own, the comments ___should___ largely dictate what code was implemented by myself.

### ExamProject3
This exam project was utilized to show the professor that we understand, and can implement, a Binary Search Tree (BST) and an AVL Tree. The project was additionally used to show the professor that we understand the difference between the Big O of both the BST and AVL Tree data structures.

### ExamProject4
This exam project was utilized to show the professor that we understand the ClosestPair algorithm. This project utilizes MergeSort to take in a bunch of points on a 2D grid, sort them, and then provide them to the ClosestPair algorithm to quickly find the closest pair of points on the 2D grid.

### ExamProject5
This exam project was utilized to show the professor that we understand how numbers are stored in the computer. The project specification had us creating a LargeNumber class that would then implement the ability to create numbers that exceeded the computers hardware limits (>64-bit). However, this was one of my only projects that I failed to implement. The iterations of code that I went through while trying to implement this project can be found within this project's source code.

### ExamProject6
This exam project had us building a graph of computers that would then be solved to find the minimum cost path between two nodes in the graph.
